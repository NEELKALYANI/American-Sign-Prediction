# American-Sign-Prediction

Hello All, I am sharing another project named American Sign Language Detection Model (TalkTogether) with you guys!!
This project enables two-way communication between deaf and non-deaf person.
This model is written in Python language and consist of two main files named server.py and client.py. 
To run both files simultaneously both systems one running server and another running client should be connected to same IP address and Port Number.
For Data Generation DataCollection.py is given.
The CNN model is trained on 'http://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/'. 
A demo Video is also uploaded for the reference!!
